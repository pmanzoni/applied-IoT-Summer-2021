# Docker for IoT

Containers are a lightweight approach to virtualization that developers can apply to rapidly develop, test, deploy, and update IoT applications at scale. Docker is an open platform for container-based virtualization. Docker makes it fast and easy to build containers and to deploy them just about anywhere: in a private or public cloud, within a local VM, or on physical hardware including IoT devices. 

This seminar will provide a brief introduction on how Docker works, its basic commands and will provide some examples on how to create images and containers
